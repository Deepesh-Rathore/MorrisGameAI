# 9 Man Morris Game AI
An AI to play 9 man morris,which is a strategy board game for two players. I have used two alogirthms Min Max and Alpha Beta Pruning for this AI. The programs are written in Java.

The program takes a text file as an input, having one line describing the current board state and outputs the board state with next best move, again in the form of a text file. The board state is represented by a char array, 21 characters long where W represents white coins, B represents black coins and X represents empty position.

# How to Run

The program takes 3 command line arguments:
	 input filename, output filename and the depth of the tree that needs to be searched.
